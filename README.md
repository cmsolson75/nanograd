# nanograd

Simple AutoGrad engine implemented in Numpy. Has NN wrapper to enable deep learning training

Inspired by micrograd and tinygrad

## Features

Autograd system for numerical operations
nn wrapper for deep learning

tested within a 1e-6 accuracy on pytorch for all numerical ops as well as higher level ops.

Essentially a Pytorch clone for CPU build in Numpy
